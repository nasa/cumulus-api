# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing and making our planet easier to explore!

We're excited you would like to contribute to Cumulus! Whether you're finding bugs, adding new features, fixing anything broken, or improving documentation, get started by submitting an issue or pull request!

## Submitting an Issue

If you have any questions or ideas, or notice any problems or bugs, first [search open issues](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus-api/issues) to see if the issue has already been submitted. We may already be working on the issue. If you think your issue is new, you're welcome to [create a new issue](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus-api/issues/new).

## Pull Requests

If you want to submit your own contributions, follow these steps:

* Fork the Cumulus API repo
* Create a new branch from the branch you'd like to contribute to
* If an issue doesn't already exist, submit one (see above)
* [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) from your fork into the target branch of the nasa/cumulus-api repo
* Be sure to [mention the corresponding issue number](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in the PR description, i.e. "Fixes Issue #10"
* Upon submission of a pull request, the Cumulus development team will review the code
* The request will then either be merged, declined, or an adjustment to the code will be requested

## Guidelines

We ask that you follow these guidelines with your contributions:

### Commits

* Make small commits that show the individual changes you are making
* Write descriptive commit messages that explain your changes

Example of a good commit message:

```
